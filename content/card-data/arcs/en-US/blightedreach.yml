    **YOUR PATH TO POWER**
     
    Plot Conspiracies to predict who will win ambitions or tie for first place. But don’t be too obvious—Rivals can foil you by guessing them. **You may abandon your Flagship to replenish your fleet. You can no longer declare ambitions yourself.**

    This ambition only gives Power for winning it—getting first place with no tie.
     
    All Members of the **Commonwealth** combine ambition values into the Commonwealth to determine place for gaining Power. *(Use individual ambition values for everything else, like objectives.)*
     
    If the Commonwealth wins, evenly divide the total Power of first and second place among Members. Ignore bonus city Power and Power remainders.
     
    If a non-Member wins, they gain ***double*** the total Power of first and second place.

    Faithful cards are a new suit of action cards. When you **secure** one from the Court, draw it into your hand.
     
    When you play one, place the card on either its ***Zeal*** or ***Wisdom*** side.
     
    Zeal lets you move, influence, battle, or tax
     
    Wisdom lets you build, repair, or secure
     
    **They have a couple differences from normal action cards:**
     
    To **Surpass** a Faithful card, you must play a Faithful card on the same side. *(So if a player leads Zeal, you only Surpass if you play Zeal. You can still Pivot to Wisdom.)*
     
    You do not seize the initiative when you **Surpass** with a "7" Faithful action card.
