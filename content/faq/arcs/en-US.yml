    - q: >-
        If I secure $link:Farseers$, does *Connected* trigger?
      a: >-
        No. $link:Farseers$ being drawn as a result of Connected does not see the timing window to then trigger its ability to look at a Rival's hand and swap a card with them.

    - q: >-
        Can I tax a city once per turn and build a ship in the same turn to use *Ruthless* twice?
      a: >-
        Each turn, you can only tax or build a ship with *Ruthless*, not both.
    - q: >-
        If a city is destroyed with *Ruthless*, when do I provoke Outrage?
      a: >-
        When you destroy a city to tax, you first provoke outrage, then gain the resource from taxing.
    - q: >-

        How does *Disorganized* interact with $link:Predictive Sensors$?
      a: >-
        $link:Predictive Sensors$ is subject to this restriction. When the Rebel uses $link:Predictive Sensors$, they can move in up to 2 ships from each adjacent system. This is because a move is defined as “number of Loyal ships from one system to an adjacent system.”
    - q: >-
        How does Disorganized interact with $link:Force Beams$?

        If you are the $link:Upstart$, have $link:Empath's Bond$, and Empath is declared, can you tax a loyal city that you do not control?
      a: >-
        The "any" in $link:Empath's Bond$ should be interpreted as "non-Loyal," and Callow should be rephrased to “You cannot tax cities that you do not control.” As a result, $link:Empath's Bond$ when active only gives the Upstart the ability to use Rival starports to build and Catapult move.
  card: Upstart

    - q: >-
        Do I have to move and battle with the same ships with *Tactical*?

      a: >-
        You must perform a legal Battle action after moving (must have a legal target to attack). Otherwise the move must be undone.

    - q: >-
        Can I spend a resource to build a city while outraged in that resource?
      a: >-
        Yes, Outrage does not stop you from spending the resource at all. It only stops you from spending it for its standard Prelude action.
    - q: >-
        Do I need to have the resource to build the city?
      a: >-
        Building a Cloud City requires spending a resource of the planet type.

        Is *Fire Rifles* modified by abilities that modify Battle?

        What happens if the cluster has no cities?

- faq:
    - q: >-
        Can you limit which ships are battling?
      a: >-
        Attacker's Loyal ships in the battle system are all “attacking ships”. Therefore, all Loyal ships in the battle system must be fresh at the start of battle to use Signal Breaker.
    - q: >-
        Does Signal Break block the Intercept generated by $link:Mirror Plating$?
      a: >-
        Signal Breaker lets you “ignore one intercept you roll”. However, this cannot ignore the intercept added by Mirror Plating, because it is not rolled.
    - q: >-
        Does Signal Break take effect before $link:Railgun Arrays$?
      a: >-
        Signal Breaker checks if all the attacking ships are fresh at the beginning of the battle, before Railgun Arrays deals one hit.

        Can Sprinter Drives activate more uses of Sprinter Drives?

    - q: >-
        Can the bonus move be a Catapult move?
      a: >-

        How does this card interact with $link:Relic Cartel$?
