    Operators:
      ID:
        Name: ID
        Text: >
          You can find cards that match a certain id by using the `id:` operator.

          This operator is special, you may also search without using the operator.

        Examples:
          - example: OATH/1
            text: Find specifically the card matching the id OATH/1.

          - example: id:=OATH/1
            text: Find specifically the card matching the id OATH/1.

          - example: -id:OATH
            text: Exclude all cards with the id OATH.

      Name:
        Name: Name
        Text: >
          You can find cards that match a certain expansion by using the `name:` or `n:` operator.

          This operator is a loose-text operator, which means that you can use partial names. You can also specify multiple expansions by separating them with a comma. If a name has spaces in its name, you must use quotation marks around the name.

        Examples:
          - example: Alchemist
            text: Cards with "alchemist" in their name.

          - example: name:alchemist
            text: Cards with "alchemist" in their name.

          - example: name:"=Alchemist"
            text: Cards that are called exactly "Alchemist".

          - example: -name:"Alchemist"
            text: Cards without "alchemist" in their name.

      Product:
        Name: Product
        Text: >
          You can find cards that are associated with a certain product/game by using the `product:` operator.

        Examples:
          - example: product:oath
            text: Cards that belong to the Oath product.

          - example: -product:root
            text: Cards that don't belong to the Root product.

      Subproduct:
        Name: Subproduct
        Text: >
          You can find cards that are associated with a certain subproduct/expansion by using the `subproduct:` operator.

        Examples:
          - example: subproduct:clockwork-1
            text: Cards that belong to the Clockwork 1 subproduct.

          - example: -subproduct:exiles-partisans
            text: Cards that don't belong to the Exiles & Partisans subproduct.

      Tag:
        Name: Tag
        Text: >
          You can find cards that have a certain tag by using the `tag:` search operator. Almost every card will have a tag. You can find a list of valid tags by using the advanced search page.

        Examples:
          - example: tag:"Power"
            text: Cards that have the Power tag.

          - example: tag:"Power,Arcane"
            text: Cards that have the Power and Arcane tags.

          - example: tag:none
            text: Cards with no tags.
