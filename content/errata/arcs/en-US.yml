As of June 2024, our plan right now is to wait a month or two in case any other errors of this nature crop up. At that point, we'll be offering an errata pack on our store with free shipping (it may have a nominal cost of 1 dollar or so). We'll also include a corrected copy in the next Arcs product. You can find a print-quality version of the file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yfvmyj5dx74e1ebzn9pav/Navy-Reprisal.pdf?rlkey=aasfbpazvczni9zfr5nv6cnbv&dl=0)."
